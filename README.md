# Check Yo' Self
A basic checklisting app. 

## Overview
Check Yo' Self is a small webapp that keeps track of your todos and tasks. To start, add a title and some tasks using the list input form, then click the "Make Task List" button to see it appear on the right! Lists are automatically stored in local storage along with any checked off tasks. Additionally, you can sort lists by urgency or title.

One of the challenges that came up during the creation of this app was how to structure the scripts. I had no idea where to start, so I decided to just start writing tests for the task and list classes. This gave me a solid structure to work off of as I was building the rest of the app.
